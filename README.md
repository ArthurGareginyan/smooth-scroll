# Smoth Scroll

The "Back to Top" button allows users to scroll back to the top of the page of website. It's a little detail which enhances navigation experience on website with long pages.

This is the JQuery code that makes the scrolling smooth. Also it make the button appear when not at the top of the window and then make the button disappear when we are at the top of the page.


## Usage

**Step 1**

Hook up this file on a web page of your website where you want to display the "Back to Top" button.

To add this JQuery into the body (to the head or footer) of HTML document you just need to wrap this code in HTML tag `<script language="JavaScript"></script>`.

Also you need to include the JQuery library to the HTML document where you wish to use the "Back to Top" button. You can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

From Google CDN:
```
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

From Microsoft CDN:
```
<script src="http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-2.0.0.min.js"></script>
```

Or you can download the jQuery library (is a single JavaScript file). Place the downloaded file in the same directory as the pages where you wish to use it. And include it with this code:
```
<script src="jquery-2.0.0.min.js"></script>
```

**Note:** the <script> tag should be inside the <head> section.


**Step 2**

Add the "id" "back-to-top" to yuor "Back to Top" button, like on this eaxmple:
```
<a href="#" id="back-to-top" >â†‘Back to Top</a>
```


##Browser support

Your "Back to Top" button will be responsive and compatible with all major browsers.
